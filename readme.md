# Send an email using Python
This is the bare minimum code written in python to send an email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), part of the internet protocol suite. 

For testing, I used a gmail account. To enable smtp from gmail, you need to create an app password, which can be done at: myaccount.google.com/u/4/apppasswords

## About

Hi, I am Brian Lesko. I am currently a robotics engineer working in Cleveland, Ohio. I received my bachelors in mechanical engineering and then my masters in Mechnical engineering from The Ohio State University in 2022 and 2024 respectively. Although my education is in mechanical engineering, I have been coding in Matlab, Python, and C++ since 2018. Outside work I have been posting the code I write for learning purposes. This code focuses on Internet communication protocols in pursuit of developing Enterprise level software for resource planning and employee management purposes. This repository just contains the bare minumum refrence for sending an email. The next steps in this project are integrating this code into a user interface for scheduling vacation time.
